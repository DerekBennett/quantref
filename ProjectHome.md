This project is intended to be a reference quantitative finance library for students working their way through books such as Hull and Clewlow and Strickland. The intent is to provide one valuation model implemented in several different languages. The first language will be Java, followed by C++, and then R. Hopefully, others will contribute further implementations. Ideally, this would represent a toolkit that a student could apply to any new corporate or educational environment.
